This is Comdb2 documentation.  If you're going to work on it, and want
to preview changes before you commit, you'll need to set up a few
things.  This'll tell you how.

Instructions for Debian-based systems follow.  Instructions for
Redhat-based systems would be welcome.

0) install a sane build environment (sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev)
1) cd docs
2) Install jekyll (sudo apt install jekyll)
3) Start server (jekyll serve --watch --host your_ip --port your_port)

The docs are in pages/*.md. The table of contents on the left is in
_data/sidebars/mydoc_sidebar.yml When you save files, jekyll should
regenerate the docs automatically.  Point your browser at
http://your_ip:your_port to view them.

Images are in docs/images, and are generated by Sqlite's scripts.
There are also svn diagrams in docs/diagram, generated with draw.io. 
You will need to load the file to draw.io to update them.

In order to change the syntax gifs from docs/images, follow the steps:
1) cd docs/src/sqlitegen
2) edit bubble-generator-data.tcl to update the syntax
2) run ./bubble-generator.tcl 
   (tcl is already a build requirement for Comdb2 and should be present)
3) click the 'Everything' button.  This will overwrite all gif files from ../../images. 
   Alternatively you can generate only change bubble diagrams.  
4) kill bubble-generator.tcl after it's done

The program depends on Tk and thus Xlib, so converting it to something that
doesn't need X isn't trivial, and probably isn't worth the time.

Note: Gif rendering done by tcl script in step (3) is not ideal, and text will
print outside bubbles in the opened preview (step 3).  This is not a problem,
a browser will render the gifs properly.
